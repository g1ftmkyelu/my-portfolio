            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>I am a software developer with 5 years of experience in Node.js, JavaScript, and PHP. I have a strong
                understanding of the full software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and analysis to
                design, implementation, testing, and deployment. I am also proficient in a variety of other
                technologies, including React, Angular, MySQL, and MongoDB.<br><br>

                I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a passion for building high-quality
                software. I am also a team player and I enjoy working collaboratively to solve problems. I am confident
                that I have the skills and experience necessary to be a valuable asset to your team.<br><br>
                In my previous role at Acme Corporation, I was responsible for developing and maintaining a large-scale
                web application. I worked closely with a team of developers to design, implement, and test the
                application. I also worked with the QA team to ensure that the application met all of the requirements.
                The application was successfully deployed on time and within budget.

                I am also an active member of the open source community. I have contributed to a number of open source
                projects, including React, Angular, and Node.js.<br><br>

                I am always looking for new challenges and I am eager to learn new technologies. I am confident that I
                can make a significant contribution to your team.</p>
